Blockchain is a type of data structure that involves a chain of blocks that is cryptographically protected with a hash function.  
The data within the blocks cannot be altered without all of the blocks being changed leading to an unique transactions.  
Blockchain promises anonymity, security, and correctness of the data being stored within these blocks.  

Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms. 
To identify patient zero, we must detect the spread of the disease and find effective treatments, especially at the beginning 
of the outbreak of the infectious disease. Currently, the focus in terms of epidemiological studies has been to prevent the 
outbreak of the diseases.  However, we must understand how to securely, quickly, identify and treat these diseases while 
maintaining the anonymity of the patient, the goal of our project.

The promised application uses blockchain technology to secure, 
store and process data. 
Data is sourced by doctors from inputs, government agencies, and other relevant sources.  
The data is then entered into the secured blockchain.  
When the data needs to be accessed, the blockchain blocks of interest are accessed and written to an easy, 
read file which is then mapped. The goal of blockchain technology is quicker data access, more secure transactions, 
and less layers of data security.  The data will be secured within the blockchain, and only data that is marked publicly 
accessible is available to the public. Blockchain technology promises to be used in the future for data storage and security. 
Blockchain aims to be a valid and safe data structure in comparison to current data structures of use.
